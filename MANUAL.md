# Manual

## Opening the Menu
The menu can currently be opened at any time the game's pause menu can (although this is probably going to be made less strict in a future version) by pressing `B`.

The menu can then be navigated with the D-Pad, `2` to select and `1` to exit.

## Map Warping
The `Change Map` option in the menu allows you to warp to any map by its internal name.

The first 3 letters of the name are the area (such as `he1` for 1-1, `ta3` for 3-3, `mac` for Flipside) and the 2 numbers are the number of the map within that area. These can scrolled through using the D-Pad. Once you've chosen the map you'd like to warp to, press `2`.

A full list of map names can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10w4CS5oNBOHHYtM9OrNUYM7GIqNxIaR-b_Sr8FSG7Pk/edit). 

By default a Dimentio teleport animation will play when you do this (thanks to JohnP55 for the idea and documentation of relevant functions), but you can turn that off by pressing `-` in the menu if you'd like.
